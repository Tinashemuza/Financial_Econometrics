# Time Series Modeling

# Problems Affecting the modeling of Time series

  1. Skewness
  2. Kurtosis/ Heteroscedasticity
  3. Sensitivity to outliers
  4. Over-reliance on the Gaussian distribution
  5. Non-stationarity

From each of the above scenarios, we are going to look at the following areas:

● Definition: Technical definition using formulas or equations

● Description: Explanation

● Demonstration: Numerical example using real-world data 

● Diagram: Visual example using real-world data

● Diagnosis: How to recognize or test that the problem exists

● Damage: Clear statement of the damaged caused by the problem

● Directions: Suggested models that can address this
